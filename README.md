# Reactified Weather

A weather app built on React, powered by Node, and styled with SCSS. It utilizes Google's [Geocode API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to convert user input into longitude/latitude coordinates, and uses those coordinates to get weather data from  the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev). 

It features current conditions, an hourly forecast, and a three day forecast, as well as Imperial/Metric conversions. It is currently hosted on Heroku.
